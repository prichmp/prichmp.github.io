# The Pebble Formatter
Write Forward uses [Pebble](http://www.mitchellbosecke.com/pebble/home) a lightweight, decently-fast template engine originally designed for webpages. Write Forward uses it to format output messages. One of the advantages of Pebble is that the message is compiled once and reused many times.

## Configuration File

The following is a sample `/src/main/resources/write-forward-config.yaml` configuration file.

{% raw %}
    writeforward:
             isslow: true
             numberofstackframes: 2
             outputs:
                  - name: console
                    format: |+ # See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790454/in-yaml-how-do-i-break-a-string-over-multiple-lines for YAML multiline strings.

                        [{{ level }}] {{ marker }} {{ timestamp }} {% if class is not empty %}{{ class }}:{{ line }}{% endif %}

                        {{ message }}

                        {% if exception is not empty %}
                        {{ exception }}

                        {% endif %}
                        {% if values is not empty %}
                        {% for value in values %}
                        {{ value.key }} = {{ value.value }}

                        {% endfor %}
                        {% endif %}

{% endraw %}

The writeforward --> outputs --> format key in the YAML file holds the format string for Pebble. By editing this format the output to the underlying logging framework is changed.
