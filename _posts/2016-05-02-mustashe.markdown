# The JMustache Formatter
Write Forward uses [jmustache](https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache) a lightweight, decently-fast template engine originally designed for webpages. Write Forward uses it to format output messages.

Consult the [Mustache documentation](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) for information about the format of mustache.

## Configuration File

The following is a sample `/src/main/resources/write-forward-config.xml` configuration file.

{% raw %}

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <writeforward slow="true" stackframes="50">
    	<outputs>
    		<output name="console">
    			<format>

    {{ timestamp }} [{{ thread }}] {{level}} {{#marker}}{{marker}} {{/marker}}{{#class}}{{ class }}.{{method}}:{{ line }}{{/class}}
    	{{ message }}
    	{{#values}}
    	{{key}} = {{value}}
    	{{/values}}
    	{{#exception}}
    	{{exception}}
    	{{/exception}}
    			</format>
    		</output>
    	</outputs>
    </writeforward>

{% endraw %}

The writeforward --> outputs --> output --> format tag in the XML file holds the format string for mustache. By editing this format the output to the underlying logging framework is changed.

The newlines after `<format>` and before `</format>` count as part of the template. You may want to put the `<format></format>` tags on the same line as the start and/or end of the template to avoid extraneous newlines.
